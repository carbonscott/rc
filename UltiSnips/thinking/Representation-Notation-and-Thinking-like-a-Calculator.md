## Question

* `?x`: what is `x`?
* `??x`: why `x`?
* `?>x`: how `x`?
* `?_x`: where/when is `x`?
* `?,x`: if `x` is true? 
* `(^[a-z]*[0-9]+)x`: mark an question point at `$1` (you have to check out regex to
  understand it) 
* Simplify/Summarize what's stated:

	> * `range + items`; The items are usually sets/collections.

	> * For example, `number + name`

## Set Theory

* Once you can assign a set to something `x`, you can manipulate `x` then. 
* The Set can be context-awared/based.

### Basic Workflow

* Identify Object Type `C` for two objects;
* Try defined Operations for either relating object in the same set `C1` or the other
  set `C2` to build up a relation between two objects;

### Advanced Workflow

* Build new operator from the old ones;
* to define **Primitive** Operator;
* to define a **Primitive** Set;

To do the last two or not depend on its predictable or reusable purpose, like is it
necessary, or is it simplified?

## More about Notation

* `?x` returns info about which **set/sets** it belongs to and a **description** of
  itself.
* `?>x`: returns steps of doing things.
* *What to do* sth can be converted to `?>make/do sth`?
