# Thought Debug 

## Types of bugs in Thought

### Recognition Error

* Dependence Error/Abstraction Error:
	* Abstraction := Remove Dependence here;
	* Redundence := Insignificant dependence;
* Memory Error;

### Reconstruction Error

* Detect by counter-examples;
* Talk to people to questioning the reconstruction, because it is very hard to
  detect the errors on your own.

### Vocabulary Error

* Traverse Not Complete;
* Out of Vocabulary;

## Reasons

* People used to processing information by predicting its behaviors, which is called
  understanding by reconstruction. 
* Transformation rule in logic derivation depends on the Dependence, which is
  introduced regarding dependece error in thought debug.
* Vocabulary is the big container that saves all information that has been
  cognized/recognized by person.
* Thought container is the big container that saves all information that has been
  used in recognition. 
* Thoguht container array is an upper-level container that saves different thought
  container.

## Discussion

### What does my I/O speed influence me?

If writing speed and reading speed of mind is inifitely fast, we can get and
retrieve information instantly. But in my case, I don't feel like I have a good
habit to memorize things. **What can I do?** 
Assume my I/O speed is a **small constant**, and I need to process an amount of
infomraiton. How can I deal with it? The least but not last way is to organize
information in such a way that I am able to achieve the best performance of
processing it out of my own I/O ability. It is also one of the major reason why it
is better to break something down into something in a level we can process. I have
to **do something on top of different levels because of my limited I/O speed**. The
very first implication of building things on top of different levels is to **expand
my vocabulary** as much as I can, which means I have more things to build upon and
take advantages of the combination fully upon.

### What can I do with my I/O speed itself?

* **Find a good way to represent/observe information**. 
	For me, the best few ways are: 

	* Visualize
	* Impersonate
	* Examplize
	* Any kinds of thinking model listed in `vocabulary.md`

* **Expand vocabulary**

If the above things are worth *adding to my vocabulary*, then do it.

### What can I say about dependence?

* Combination is the simplest **dependence**, like put things together.
* Recursion is the repetitive form of **combination**.
* Abstraction means to **remove** certain **dependence** out of a **comparison**.
* Examplization means to **add** certain **dependence** out of an **example**.

### How to live with learning curve for me? 

* Get to know it and find a good way to **represent** it for me;
* Add it to vocabulary;
* Play with it by being **Creative**;
