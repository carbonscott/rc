# Thought Debug 

## Types of bugs in Thought

### Recognition Error

* Dependence Error/Abstraction Error:
	* Abstraction := Remove Dependence here;
* Memory Error;

### Reconstruction Error

* Detect by counter-examples;
* Talk to people to questioning the reconstruction, because it is very hard to
  detect the errors on your own.

### Vocabulary Error

* Traverse Not Complete;
* Out of Vocabulary;

## Reasons

* People used to processing information by predicting its behaviors, which is called
  understanding by reconstruction. 
* Transformation rule in logic derivation depends on the Dependence, which is
  introduced regarding dependece error in thought debug.
* Vocabulary is the big container that saves all information that has been
  cognized/recognized by person.
* Thought container is the big container that saves all information that has been
  used in recognition. 
* Thoguht container array is an upper-level container that saves different thought
  container.

## Discussion

### What does my I/O speed influence me?

If writing speed and reading speed of mind is inifitely fast, we can get and
retrieve information instantly. But in my case, I don't feel like I have a good
habit to memorize things. **What can I do?** 
Assume my I/O speed is a small constant, and I need to processing an amount of
infomraiton. How can I deal with it? The least but not last way is to organize
information in such a way that I am able to achieve the best performance of
processing information out of my own I/O ability. This is also one of the major
reason why it is better to break something down into something in a level we can
process. I have to do something on top of different levels because of my limited I/O
speed. 
The very first implication of building things on top of different levels is to
**expand my vocabulary** as much as I can.

### What can I do with my I/O speed itself?

**Find a good way to represent/code information**. For me, the best few ways are: 

* Visualize
* Impersonate

### What can I say about dependence?

* Combination is the simplest **dependence**, like put things together.
* Recursion is the simplest **combination**.
* Abstraction means to **remove** certain dependence out of a **comparison**.
