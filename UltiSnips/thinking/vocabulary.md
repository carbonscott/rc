# Responsible for your code

* `Clear Frustrated, Rerefresh Love and passion, break down impossible into
  something possible.`

# Logic Thinking

* State: descriptive assumption (static); 
	* List of examples, and abstract the definition and then make it a stated assumption;
* Transition relation: transformation assumption (dynamic); This is the relation that connects the new state and the original state;
	* Recursion: a special transformation rule; `I can solve it` because `I can solve it`.
	* Based on example and abstract the relation between stated assumptions;

# Systematic Thinking

* Vocabulary;
	* Complete Set of Components;
	* Complex can be made up of or constructed by Simple or Reusable Components;
	* Break down Impossible into something possible;
	* Go through everyone;
	* Expand limited vocabluary;

# Critical Thinking

* Anti-systematic thinking in some cases, a special trial, like using logic, to go beyond vocabulary;
* To be different;

# Strategic Thinking

* I don't understand it well, it is related to organization.
* Professional/Expert Thinking;
* Combination of different thinking;

# Associative Thinking -- Divergent thinking

* Divergent thinking: Try to connect to one thing with different or deep level examples;
* Lateral thinking; Thinking by connection;
* Vertical thinking; Thinking by Analysis or Perspective;

# Simplify -- Convergent thinking

* Trial and Error;
* Find associated tweakable parameters that monitors all the trial and error states;
	* keep aware of the difference of each trials;
	* do error checking as much as possible;
	* such as a number indicating assumption states;
* Name a type -- a container for information organized;
* Name sth belonged to a type and for users to call; 
	* Two things belonged to same type for instance;
	* Identifiers are needed to distinguish them when they are used;


# Language -- Literal Relation
