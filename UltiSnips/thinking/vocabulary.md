# Responsible for your code

* `Clear Frustration, Rerefresh Love and Passion, Do it, try to break down
  impossible into something possible.`

# Three List

* Observable-Oriented
* Breakable-Oriented
* Remainder (not break down yet)
	* No dependence to the vocabulary found
	* Exception due to diversity
	* Break-down components are not independent
* Choose the right one: choose the most valued candidate from a list.
	* what are probable candidates?
	* sort by value;
	* which one is the most valued?

# Representation/Observation Technique

* BREAK DOWN things to different INDEPENDENT components associated with
  vocabulary/thought container.
  Make it readable to do two key steps in thinking algorithm: 
  * add dependence: main vs components
  * remove dependence: component vs component
* It is like to observe a vector in terms of basis vectors, and it helps user to
  focus on manageablea (dependence to vocabulary is established) things.
* Vocabulary makes user observe/recognize and figure out combination;
* Remove redundence from observors;
* Vocabulary for Meta-Thinking and Non-Meta Thinking.
* **Expand vocabulary** for either Meta-Thinking or Non-Meta Thinking, and for each
  module-associated vocabulary.
	* Example Pool in Case Study Module
	* Unconcious Vocabulary: 
		* First Nature;
		* Second Natrue;
		* Nature Under Construction;

# Expanding Vocabulary for Meta Thinking 

## Logic Thinking

* State: descriptive assumption (static); 
	* List of examples, and abstract (remove dependency) the definition and then make it a stated assumption;
* Transition relation: transformation assumption (dynamic); This is the relation that connects the new state and the original state;
	* Recursion: a special transformation rule; `I can solve it` because `I can solve it`.
	* Based on example and abstract the relation between stated assumptions;

## Systematic Thinking

* Choose from candidates;
* Vocabulary: Complete Set of Components;
	* Complex can be made up of or constructed by Simple or Reusable Components;
	* Go through every one in the vocabulary;
	* Expand limited vocabulary;
	* Break down Impossible into something possible;

## Algorithmatic Thinking

* Sequence: one after another;
* Selection: conditioning by test;
* Repition: keep changing sth until it is in another range;

## Critical Thinking

* Anti-systematic thinking in some cases, a special trial, like using logic, to go beyond vocabulary;
* To be different;

## Strategic Thinking

* I don't understand it well, it is related to organization.
* Professional/Expert Thinking;
* Combination of different thinking;

## Associative Thinking -- Divergent thinking

* Divergent thinking: Try to connect to one thing with different or deep level examples;
* Lateral thinking; Thinking by connection;
* Vertical thinking; Thinking by Analysis or Perspective;

## Simplify -- Convergent thinking

* Trial and Error;
* Find associated tweakable parameters that monitors all the trial and error states;
	* keep aware of the difference of each trials;
	* do error checking as much as possible;
	* such as a number indicating assumption states;
* Abstract things (Remove Dependency) and Name a type -- a container for information
  organized;
* Name sth belonged to a type and for users to call; 
	* Two things belonged to same type for instance;
	* Identifiers are needed to distinguish them when they are used;

## Creative -- Make your own game

* Ask Question;
* Design a solvable problem/exercise;
* Make hypothesises and check what-if;

You can never say you are familiar with sth until you can be creative on top of
that.

## Case study -- Learn from examples

Cases have more unawared but useuful side information for me. It might help me
better represent the data before I am able to abstract it.

* Simple Examplize;
* Make analogy;
* Learn from examles/example pools;

## Checking Awareness

* Exception Awareness;
* Wrong dependence assigned;
	* if the dependence is really assigned, what can be determined by this
	  assignment?
