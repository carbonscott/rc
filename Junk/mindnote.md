# Psychology about thinking
* Are you ready to start thinking?
* How well you understand this problem?
  * build mode
	+ representation (state mode) to build thinking unit
	+ transformation (change mode) && interpretation (explain mode) to build new
	  thinking unit
	+ all sources are from copy mode
  * volcabulary mode
	+ global thinking (systematic mode), check one by one in the system/vocabulary,
   	avoid to ignore something unfamiliar but reachable and significant
	+ add new one (learning mode)
* Point
  * declarative + derivative + interpretive
  * quantum-leaply new
* What resource/strategy can be used/implemented to meet each objective?
	* resource enquiry
	* figure out steps
* Tend Not To Hold Grudges

## what is understanding
**understand** means to interprete something into *recongnizable*
representations/statements *asymptotically*. Process of understanding is
*automatically* occuring once you are ready to understand something.
## Focus and do whatever you can do about it
* make full use of what I know to understand
* expand what-I-know boxes through learning
## After turning point = Enjoyable Focus 
Keep energy, go and pass **turning point**, your next level will be much easier and
enjoyable. 


## Representation by hand and Interpretation by mind
### Simplify
* Goal and Purpose: make it what it is/means and clear
* naming/pattern
* analogue (make it scalable)
* diagramming
* categorizing (organizing)
* unit test (as helloworld like EXAMPLE unit to test structure of program)
* logic rules (exclusive rule, false rule)
* resource enquiry 
* resource manipulate -- figure out steps  

### Diversify
* Goal and Purpose: make it yet another one
(More representation by hand; More Interpretation by mind; There's always an angle to see something unless it's blocked; Use a clear representation, such as step by step rep;)

## Systematic Thinking
### Analysis
(Fuck into conceivable components)
Control one of Variables 

### Synthesis
(Big picture, Combination of small parts for synergistic use)

## Others
### Self-Strengthen 
* Goal and Purpose: back to nature
* Begin or continue with what I can do; Try what you can do in n+ ways. It ensures you are doing something rather than waiting. This is also the way to make progress rather than stay somewhere.
* Serve my purpose;
(Flow my heart; Have Fun; 
Try doing in the most natural way, like paper and pencil; They are used as buffer to memory in my mind. Natural way is also memory-resource-saving friendly.
zoom in or zoom out when interpreting my situation; or switch)
Stress and release.
* Mistake is my teacher, Hope is a good thing. 

### Copy Statement (Mode)
Goal and Purpose: Learning and Getting it done! 
(Have no idea but do it)
(Read the fucking manual/script that is already displayed)
(Learn is not the first purpose, getting it done is the first purpose!)
(Know more, do more, do better.)

# Experience about organizing

# Experience about maintainability
* stay peaceful about distracting
