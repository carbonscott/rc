# Thinking let me transform unexpected and tedious things into set of questions 
# which can draw y attention and light up my passion. 
#
# Make one effort to solve one problem.
#
# Do I have passion to make it better and cool?
# Do I have passion to make it work and cool?

# About cool:
#   - growing from subsets 
#
# Am I clear what I am doing.   
#                               
# Thinking is driven by many aspects. Keep myself clear about where I am going. 
#
# Sequence matters because we are always doing things in steps. 
#                               
# Sort subsets, get each subset perfectly done.
#
# If I feel hard to reach the SUPERSET, it is often due to that 
# I haven't figured out the SUBSET to complete. 
# 
# What SUBSETs can tell me at least is that things should be narrowed down to 
# simple COMPONENTs.
#
# Vim is an editor, it's not emacs which does everything.
#
# I am able to mimic it!

# Linux Design Goal: do one thing and do it well.

# Interpolation
# -------------
# 
# * `$ : @` : `:` means where. 
# 
# 				An inline interpolation is declared. Some item in $ is going  to be
# 				substituted by the item transformation rule in @.
# 
# * `% = ${transformed}` : `%` means the result of interpolation.
