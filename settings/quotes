# If something can be DESCRIBED by language, it can be LEARNED.

# If I feel hard to reach the SUPERSET, it is often due to that 
# I haven't figured out the SUBSET to complete. 
#
# Sort subsets, get each subset perfectly done.
#
# Simplify what I see as subset, organize what I think about in terms of subsets.
#
# Vim is an editor, it's not emacs which does everything.

# Interpolation
# -------------
# 
# * `$ : @` : `:` means where. 
# 
# 				An inline interpolation is declared. Some item in $ is going  to be
# 				substituted by the item transformation rule in @.
# 
# * `% = ${transformed}` : `%` means the result of interpolation.
