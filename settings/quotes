# Work Harder
# 
# Effort made will be paid off in terms of results. 
# 
# To start challenging myself is the biggest challenge.
# 
# Thinking without paying effort is simply brainless.
# 
# Sequence matters because we are always doing things in steps. 
#                               
# Sort subsets, get each subset perfectly done.
#
# If I feel hard to reach the SUPERSET, it is often due to that 
# I haven't figured out the SUBSET to complete. 
# 
# What SUBSETs can tell me at least is that things should be narrowed down to 
# simple COMPONENTs.
#
# Vim is an editor, it's not emacs which does everything.
#
# Linux Design Goal: do one thing and do it well.

# Interpolation
# -------------
# 
# - `$ : @` : `:` means where. 
# 
# 				An inline interpolation is declared. Some item in $ is going  to be
# 				substituted by the item transformation rule in @.
# 
# - `% = ${transformed}` : `%` means the result of interpolation.

# Postfix Modifier
# ----------------
# - Modifier List |a,b,c|
# - properties: object.|property|
# - interactive properties: object.|property|(...)
# - inline properties definition: 
#						-	(a + b) # +,scalar sum,binary
# - ugly non-inline version of Modifier List:
#   Just put bracket {} in the |modifier list|, like,
#						-	(a + b) # ( 
#										 operator  : +,
#											definition: scalar sum,
#											property  : binary
#        )

# Subset ~>
# (sigma,v) ~> <symmetry operation>;
