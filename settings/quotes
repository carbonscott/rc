# Inspiring
#==========

# Effort made will be paid off in terms of results. 
# 
# To start challenging myself is the biggest challenge.
# 
# Thinking without paying effort is simply brainless.
# 
# Sequence matters because we are always doing things in steps. 
#                               
# Sort subsets, get each subset perfectly done.
#
# If I feel hard to reach the SUPERSET, it is often due to that 
# I haven't figured out the SUBSET to complete. 
# 
# What SUBSETs can tell me at least is that things should be narrowed down to 
# simple COMPONENTs.
#
# Vim is an editor, it's not emacs which does everything.
#
# Linux Design Goal: do one thing and do it well.

# Interpolation
# -------------
# 
# * `$ : @` : `:` means where. 
# 
# 				An inline interpolation is declared. Some item in $ is going  to be
# 				substituted by the item transformation rule in @.
# 
# * `% = ${transformed}` : `%` means the result of interpolation.
#
# Set

# 8 > 9 .|subset| --> [logic value]
# [logic value] := (true, false)
#
# rasie a question.|example| --> [what] : ^1
#     - allow me to focus on what I need to care -- about rasing a question.
#     - put the type of question I want to ask later -- in set [].
#     - rephrase: what examples I can have about rasing a question?
#     
#     %^1: "." notation benefit over "^" notation .|compare| --> [what] : ^2
#
#         %^2: 
#         - more standard
