# Sort things if I don't want to waste time on weakly/less sorted things.
#
# Sort subsets, get each subset perfectly done.

# If I feel hard to reach the SUPERSET, it is often due to that 
# I haven't figured out the SUBSET to complete.

# Vim is an editor, it's not emacs which does everything.
#
# Thinking is driven by many aspects. Keep myself clear about where I am going. 

# Category
# --------
# 
# * `$ ~> @` : `$` is subset of `@`. 
# * `If $_ ~> @ --> %; Then it's likely that $a :~> @ --> %`.
# * `@` is not figured out, but constructed from sorted building blocks/subsets. 
# 
# Interpolation
# -------------
# 
# * `$ : @` : `:` means where. 
# 
# 				An inline interpolation is declared. Some item in $ is going  to be
# 				substituted by the item transformation rule in @.
# 
# * `% = ${transformed}` : `%` means the result of interpolation.
