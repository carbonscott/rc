# Effort made will be paid off in terms of results. 
# 
# To start challenging myself is the biggest challenge.
# 
# Sequence matters because we are always doing things in steps. 
# --------                      
#
# Sort subsets, get each subset perfectly done.
#      -------
#
# If I feel hard to reach the SUPERSET, it is often due to that 
# I haven't figured out the SUBSET to complete. 
# 
# What SUBSETs can tell me at least is that things should be narrowed down to 
# simple COMPONENTs.
#
# Vim is an editor, it's not emacs which does everything.
#
# Linux Design Goal: do one thing and do it well.
#
# What questions is hard to answer.

# 'is it' questions is easier (results in yes or no) and keeps you trying new answer.
